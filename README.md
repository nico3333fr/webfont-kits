# Webfonts useful for websites
 
Just to save time and avoid using a service like Google Fonts!
Feel free to keep only `woff` and `woff2` if you prefer.
Fonts are under their licenses.

Except if specified `*_full_subset`, webfonts are using western-latin subset (less heavy). If other subsets are not needed, prefer avoid using `*_full_subset` ones.
